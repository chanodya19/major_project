# major_project

## Overview
The major project asseses a subset of RNA-Seq data obtained from a gene expression study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE182617.
The subset of data being analysed includes Col 0 ecotype _Arabidopsis thaliana_ plants that were trated with Salicylic acid at timepoint 0h and 24h

Following replicates are present 
File name | Treatment hour | FIle description 
--- | --- | ------- |
Col0_SA_treated_0h_rep1.fastq.gz | 0h | Biological replicate 1 (rep1) of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype (Col0) treated with Salicylic Acid (SA) for 0 hours (0h)
Col0_SA_treated_0h_rep2.fastq.gz | 0h | Biological replicate 2 (rep2) of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype (Col0) treated with Salicylic Acid (SA) for 0 hours (0h)
Col0_SA_treated_0h_rep3.fastq.gz | 0h | Biological replicate 3 (rep3) of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype (Col0) treated with Salicylic Acid (SA) for 0 hours (0h)
Col0_SA_treated_24h_rep1.fastq.gz | 24h | Biological replicate 1 (rep1) of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype (Col0) treated with Salicylic Acid (SA) for 24 hours (24h)
Col0_SA_treated_24h_rep2.fastq.gz | 24h | Biological replicate 2 (rep2) of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype (Col0) treated with Salicylic Acid (SA) for 24 hours (24h)
Col0_SA_treated_24h_rep3.fastq.gz | 24h | Biological replicate 3 (rep3) of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype (Col0) treated with Salicylic Acid (SA) for 24 hours (24h)

The final research goal was to identify the differentially expressed genes within the Salicylic acid hormone pathwayand different pathways regulated by salicylic acid.
